I was sad to see that no one picked this up, even if this blog post is from 2009.
And even if I am MILES away from possessing the same technical skills as, for example,
Ivan Femia and Gregor Wolf, the creators/maintainers of ABAP2XLSX, I took it to
myself to try and get this project actually going. Everything has a beginning, I
am hoping someday this project will get some contributors, hopefully more skilled
than me, and we might create something that could be helpful as the ABAP2XLSX I
mentioned above.

If you want to contribute, please try to follow general ABAP objects guidelines provided here:

Thank you!
